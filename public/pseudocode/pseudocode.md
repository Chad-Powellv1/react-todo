# **React To-do App**

### **Main Goal**: Display items in a to-do list and their active status. The app should retain state upon revisiting the application page and utilize local storage.

  - Dynamically render content using React components
  - Use local storage for to-do data
  - Display all to-do list items

  - Display count of remaining items
  - Remove items (soft delete)
  - Check off all items (complete all)
